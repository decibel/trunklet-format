Trunklet is an extensible templating system for Postgres. It supports storing
templates to be used later, as well as creating new templating languages.

Trunklet-format is a template language for trunklet that is based on the
Postgres format() function. The largest difference is that trunklet-format
allows for naming variables/parameters, which makes it much easier to work with
for large/complex templates.

= Trunklet Overview
http://pgxn.org/dist/trunklet[Trunklet] allows many options for dealing with templates. The most relevant ones are shown below. Full documentation on trunklet can be found https://github.com/decibel/trunklet/blob/master/doc/trunklet.asc[here].

= Template specification
Trunklet-format templates use the same general rules as the http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/functions-string.html#FUNCTIONS-STRING-FORMAT[format() function], except that parameters in the template are named and positions are not supported. Currently widths are not supported either; they are a TODO. The specification is:

----
%parameter_name%type
----

_parameter_name_ can be any string, but may not contain a line break or a %.

_type_ must be one of s, I or L. They operate as specified in the format() documentation.

= Parameter specification
Parameters are specified as a JSON object containing key/value pairs. (Eventually it may accept an array of http://pgxn.org/dist/pair[pairs]). The JSON type for each value must be string, number, boolean or null. The value of each key will be cast to text, formatted via format() and then used to replace each occurrence of the parameter in the template.
